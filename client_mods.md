**Performance Mods**: These mods provide performance enhancements and are *highly* recommended while playing on any server to have decent framerates and performance. Highlights:

| Mod                 |                                                             |

| AntiGhost           | Press `g` (configurable) to remove ghost blocks when mining |
| FPS Reducer         | Reduce FPS when afk to improve computer performance         |
| Iris                | Use optifine shaders in Fabric                              |
| Ok Zoomer           | Zoom hotkey (like optifine)                                 |

There are others but they don't need as much customization

**Required Mods**: These mods must be installed to play on the Friends SMP

See the mods overview for information
